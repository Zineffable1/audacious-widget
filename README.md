# audacious-widget
A KDE Plasma 6 Widget for the Audacious music player.  


I made this to work in conjunction with my file tree search plugin or the status icon plugin included in the audacious plugins package. 
If using my file tree plugin you are good to go, but if using the status icon plugin, hide it with system tray settings so you dont have two icons.  
Both of these plugins have the close to system tray option which works well with this widget.

The status icon plugin scroll function was not working for me so I made this widget and fell down a rabbit hole.  



Clicking the icon plays/pauses.      
Double clicking opens up the window if hidden, and if Audacious has not been started yet it starts it up.  
Changeable scroll functions on the icon, including horizontal or shift + scroll. (Change volume, track, or seek)  
Tooltip that shows current track info and volume %.  
Added current time/total track time indicator to the tooltip.  
Context menu items can be reordered and hidden at the users discretion.

Hopefully will replace the tooltip with an interactable window of sorts.
