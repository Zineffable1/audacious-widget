# audacious-widget
A KDE Plasma 6 Widget for the Audacious music player.  

DEPENDENCIES  
qdbus, which should come with Plasma 6.  


I made this to work in conjunction with my file tree search plugin or the status icon plugin included in the audacious plugins package. 
If using my file tree plugin you are good to go, but if using the status icon plugin, hide it with system tray settings so you dont have two icons.

That plugins scroll function was not working for me so I made this widget. 



Clicking the icon plays/pauses.    
Double clicking opens up the window if hidden, and if Audacious has not been started yet it starts it up.  
Changeable scroll functions on the icon, including horizontal or shift + scroll. (Change volume, track, or seek)  
Tooltip that shows current track info and volume %.  
Added current time/total track time indicator to the tooltip.

Hopefully will replace the tooltip with an interactable window of sorts.
