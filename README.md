# audacious-widget
A KDE Plasma 6 Widget for the Audacious music player.  

DEPENDENCIES  
wmctrl  
audtool  


I made this to work in conjunction with the status icon plugin included in the audacious plugins package.  
That plugins scroll function was not working for me so I made this.  
I still have the plugin enabled for now as to allow for hiding the program; but I just hide it with system tray settings.


Clicking the icon plays/pauses.  
Double clicking opens up the window if hidden, and if Audacious has not been started yet it starts it up.  
Changeable scroll functions on the icon, including horizontal or shift + scroll. (Change volume, track, or seek)  
Tooltip that shows current track info and volume %.

Will be adding "seek bar", and hopefully replace the tooltip with an interactable window of sorts. May not require the status icon plugin in future.
